#The Nautilus development team started with new project development. They have created different Git 
#repositories to manage respective project's source code. One of the repositories /opt/demo.git was
#created recently. The team has given us a sample index.html file that is currently present on jump host
#under /tmp directory. The repository has been cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in
#Stratos DC.

Copy sample index.html file from jump host to storage server under cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo, further add/commit the file and push to the master branch.
